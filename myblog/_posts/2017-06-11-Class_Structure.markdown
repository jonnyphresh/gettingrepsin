This method will outline the basic time structure and progression of a basic student. A basic student is one who does not want to enter the water.

An advanced student willingly advances themselves into the water.

An expert level student is one who can perform all 4 strokes for one length.

A master level student is one who can demonstrate and teach strokes to other students who need help.

A basic instructor can progress students from not wanting to enter the water, into students who will enter the water under their own free will and enjoy the lesson.

An expert level instructor will turn the stroke learning experience into one that the students enjoy doing and will progress one class of students from Beginner to expert.

A master instructor can demonstrate to all other instructors how to teach any activity in the book. Once this level of practice is achieved then they can develop their own practice with giving us a 10% fee which goes to a charity of the master instructor's choice.

* Level 1. White Suit.
* Level 2. Blue Suit.
* Level 3. Purple Suit.
* Level 4. Brown Suit.
* Level 5. Black Suit.

There is one fundamental truth. Either things work, or they don't work. This is the fundamental law behind swimming. For instance, if you look down, you go up.

# There are no age limits to these suits. Anyone can be a white Suit and anyone can be a black Suit. It all depends on their level of ability to demonstrate the techniques. Once a student achieves a black Suit level, they can begin the learning to teach method to profit from the method they have learned.

# This method has the economic potential to change the way we see the swim lesson industry and make it clear who can swim where, so lifeguards at public pools, to the ocean, to parents at private pools, will understand where their child is at any given point in time. These suits can be customizable and can be individualized at the student's disgression and can be purchased at any retail outlet.

# A Suit will be provided to them upon achievement of correct demonstration of activities performed at a given level as part of an enrollment fee. The value to the student will come in the text and the photographs of execution of various activities that will earn a given student a given Suit.

Expert Students will be given a handbook and need to pass a given set of homeworks to attempt to understand on their own before they come to class. They will have a visualization in their mind before they enter into an activity and will have to verbalize the main things that are happening.
